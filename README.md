# AWS Secrets Manager PHP

PHP library to access AWS Secrets Manager for Application, local storage of secrets in JSON file

FYI, This is a mirrored Git Repo from: https://git.alloylab.com/open-source/aws-secrets-manager-php
But please open all issues here on GitHub, I use Gitlab for the CI/CD workflows.

Thanks!
